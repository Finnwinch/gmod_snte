ABOUT SNTE
##########

SNTE is a preventive security script against the use of menu exploits on your server, initially imagined by Meepen and then fully recoded by Maks and Zaros SNTE will be able to protect your server against the horde of young cheaters who try to exploit security holes through too old or poorly developed addons on the workshop and gmodstore.

SNTE works quickly and smoothly to capture as many suspicious users as possible, you don't have a complicated menu or a long list of convars to set up, everything is set up to work without asking you for too much fine tuning.

Why you should install SNTE
##########

garrysmod is a powerful game and very complete in term of contents, there are thousands of addons available on the workshop/gmodstore/garrysmod.org, the problem is that many addons are developed without performing real verification on the client side.

it's a problem if the addon in question allows you to make millions of currencies appear or worse to become an 'admin'..

whether using a mod menu written in lua or C++ no protection means death for the server administration team, the SNTE team believes that it is their duty to offer a powerful and free addon to reach the largest number of people and thus offer a more secure space on each server , there are more advanced systems but paying, a real shame according to Yoh Sambre.

to take SNTE it is the insurance to have a base to protect a minimum against the very very many cheaters who pullulate on garrysmod.

if you have any suggestions for possible features to add or modify we are open to discussion, just write a correct message on the spaces dedicated to that
